This is a collection of all my school work.

The repo is still under construction as I am still doing labs and taking new courses. I am creating this repo to keep my work organized and to be able to showcase my work to prospective employers. Currently, I have my work saved across various hard drives and USB sticks so I have to find missing files and also modify any work that I am not proud of.

If you are here to copy my lab work, don't, you will only hurt yourself when you have to write the exam without my code.
