    # get_height() - 1.

    # To blur the pixel at location (x, y), we use that pixel's RGB components,

# Here is one way we could extend the filter to do this:
#
# Visit the four corner pixels, blurring each one by averaging the pixel's
# components with those of its two neightbours; e.g., blur the pixel
# @ (0, 0) by using the components @ (0, 0), (1, 0) and (0, 1).
#
# Next, visit all the pixels on the edges except for the corner pixels.
# Blur each pixel by averaging the pixel's components with those of its
# three neigbours; e.g., blur the pixel @ (1, 0) by using the components
# @ (1, 0), (0, 0), (1, 1) and (2, 0).
#
# Make this change to the filter.
